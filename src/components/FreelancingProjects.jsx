        <strong>My Freelancing Journey:</strong> <br />
        I started freelancing in early 2022, driven by a passion for building
        real-world solutions and collaborating with clients worldwide. My
        journey began on platforms like Upwork and Fiverr, where I quickly
        learned the importance of communication, reliability, and delivering
        quality work. Over time, Iâ€™ve worked with clients from the US, Europe,
        and the Middle East, helping them turn their ideas into successful
        digital products.
        <br />
        <br />
        Today, I continue to freelance remotely, focusing on web and mobile
        development projects for startups, small businesses, and entrepreneurs.
